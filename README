Pitchless Blobuliser - interactive audio visual installation created for and
first shown at the London TAA 2010.

Takes a feed from a camera and generates visuals and audio based on your
movement. So get in front of the camera and wibble about like a loon :)

the main processing application along with the OpenCV, ControlP5 and Beads
libs. 

Drop the Blobuliser directory into you processing sketch folder and open via
